# Overview

The Tapioca protocol is built with a lot of different smart contracts, scattered across 5 repositories.
It's an _Omnichain_ protocol working the LayerZero messaging layer. At its core, Tapioca ERC20/ERC721 contracts uses the LayerZero contracts and infrastructure.


The other repos are here to support the ecosystem as well as to create a synergy between the tokenemics and the protocol features.

* [TapiocaBar](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/Tapioca-bar) Core logic of the protocol. This is where `USDO` gets minted and lent.
* [tapiocaz](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/TapiocaZ) Contracts that contains a wrapper named `TOFT`, which is used to wrap gas tokens and transfer allow their usage through the LayerZero network.
* [YieldBox](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tap-yieldbox) A "BentoBox v2". Acts as a vault, that allow for yield strategies to be applied on the asset.
* [yieldbox-strategies](https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/tapioca-yieldbox-strategies) Yield strategies that will be used by a YieldBox asset.



# Notes
- The docs provide a lot of information about the protocol and the user flow, given the size of the protocol, we encourage checking it at https://docs.tapioca.xyz/tapioca/.

## Out of scope

Contract marked by `// External`, which all are `node_modules/` external pacakages.

# Additional Context

Our implementation of TapiocaDAO's tw, otherwise known as Time Weighted Average Magnitude Lock. 
tw is a mechanism proposed as a solution for promoting sustainable economic growth for a decentralized finance ecosystem, while maintaining economic alignment among its participants. 

tw addresses issues created by the prevailing practice of liquidity mining, which results in small groups of opportunistic capital providers motivated solely by profit capturing all benefits at the expense of all other actors. 
tw was designed with game theory concepts to reach subgame perfect Nash equilibria, in contrast with liquidity mining where Nash equilibrium cannot be reached due to the presence of a dominant strategy

Miscellaneous: 
- An EIP2612 integration for an ERC721 was used.
- `transferFrom` should be assumed to always be used with the `Pearlmit` (Uniswap's `permit2` alike) contract, instead of the actual token's `transferFrom`.
- LayerZero composed calls are supposed to be called on independent transactions given sequential indexes. However for security purposed, all composed calls will be executed in a single transaction.
- The blockchains that should be assumed for this contest are: `Arbitrum, Ethereum, Optimism, Avalanche`.
- In the event of a DoS, the duration would be 8 hours.

- [ ] Please list specific ERC20 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with. Could be "any" (literally anything, fee on transfer tokens, ERC777 tokens and so forth) or a list of tokens you envision using on launch.
- [ ] Please list specific ERC721 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with.
- [ ] Which blockchains will this code be deployed to, and are considered in scope for this audit?
- [ ] Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable
- [ ] In the event of a DOS, could you outline a minimum duration after which you would consider a finding to be valid? This question is asked in the context of most systems' capacity to handle DoS attacks gracefully for a certain period.
- [ ] Is any part of your implementation intended to conform to any EIP's? If yes, please list the contracts in this format: 
  - `Contract1`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPX`
  - `Contract2`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPY`

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)
*List specific areas to address - see [this blog post](https://medium.com/code4rena/the-security-council-elections-within-the-arbitrum-dao-a-comprehensive-guide-aa6d001aae60#9adb) for an example*

## Main invariants
*Describe the project's main invariants (properties that should NEVER EVER be broken).*

*twAML Invariants*
- No lock can be created and unlocked in the same block
- No lock can be created and unlocked before its (original, uint256) duration has expired.
- Given a small amount of dust, I can never reach X multiple.
- I can never lock for longer than X (intended soft max cap enforced by math if not added via require).
- The sum of all balances at a given epoch, is the sum of all active locks.
- If I could have unlocked at epoch X, then the totalSum of Balances at epoch X reflects that.
